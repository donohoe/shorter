# Shorter

## What is this?

It is a very basic URL shortener plugin that uses the original Post ID as the basis for a short URL.

## What does that mean?

It means that if the URL for a WordPress post is:

https://restofworld.org/2021/hi-im-disaster-bot/

And the Post ID for that post is `19832`

Then you can use this URL:

https://restofworld.org/s/19832

as a shorter URL that automatically redirects to the canonical (original) post URL.

## Should I use a URL Shortener?

Short answer (no pun intended), No.

However if you must then this isn't a terrible otpion. The Post ID is always unique to a post.

In general you should avoid URL shortener servives as they have often be used to hide URL paramaters and other tracking junk. They real need for a shortener died years ago when Twitter stopped counting character length of a URL when composing tweets.
